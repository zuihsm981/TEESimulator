/**
 * The daemon's view onto the device log, for the WebUI's Logs panel. It no longer spawns a `logcat`
 * child: an in-process native reader ([nativeRun], in libteesim_logcat.so) reads logd directly through
 * liblog's reader API, filters in C to the lines we keep — every `TEESimulator` line (the daemon, the
 * TA and both native interceptors log under that tag), `AndroidRuntime` and fatal-level lines
 * (Java/native crash reports), and, once the interceptor is injected, every line from the target
 * keystore process ([targetPid]) — and serves
 * them two ways: a bounded ring the WebUI polls incrementally ([snapshot]), and rotating files under
 * [Const.logDir] so a crash's context survives a restart.
 *
 * The old `logcat`-subprocess reader pulled the WHOLE device stream through a pipe and regex-filtered
 * it in the JVM, so any flood (e.g. the KeyAdmin accept loop in #265) was carried at full volume into
 * the daemon and amplified by the very reader meant to observe it. The native reader filters at the
 * source and captures nothing under its own identity, so there is no feedback path to spin on.
